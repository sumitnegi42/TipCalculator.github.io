# Tip-Calculator
Decided how much to tip? After having a wonderfull Lunch/Dinner, calculating it then spliting the amount into group members, calcutaing the total amount including the bill and the tip, then dividing the that amount into the group.

Do it all or just calculate the tip amount , with ease in one place no hassel going through the calculator or calculating on you own, just enter the bill amount, tip % , and no of members in group and you get all the nessesary calculated amount in a matter of seconds.

Lessons Learned
It was a wonderfull learning all the Html , css and JavaScript basics yet more to learn , but for me implementing things are more fun than learning So took a shot at making a tip calculator using the things I learned till now.
